                <h2>Hi, I am sadiq</h2>
                <p>I’m endlessly curious about how things work — from engines and drones to AI and the mysteries of space.<br>For me, engineering isn’t just about solving problems, it’s about asking better questions and exploring ideas that push me to learn more every day.<br>This space is where I share my experiments, thoughts, and the journey of figuring things out — one challenge at a time.</p>
                <h3>you can find about me from the above grids </h3>
            </div>
            <div class  = "about">
                <h1 id = "about">About me</h1>
                <p>I am someone who is endlessly curious about how things work — whether it’s a machine, an idea, or the universe itself. For me, engineering isn’t just a subject I study; it’s a way of looking at the world with questions in mind: Why does this work the way it does? What happens if I change it? How could it be better?</p>
                <p>I’m fascinated by connections — between mechanical parts and living systems, between code and creativity, between the human mind and the cosmos. I enjoy experimenting, learning, and challenging myself, not because I want to check boxes of achievement, but because discovery feels natural to me.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I value reflection as much as innovation. Philosophy helps me pause and think about meaning, while photography and time in nature remind me to notice the details that others might overlook. Whether I’m reading, playing chess, or cooking, I approach things with patience, curiosity, and a desire to grow.</p>
                <p>What defines me most is not expertise, but the drive to keep exploring — to learn across disciplines, to connect ideas, and to see the world not just as it is, but as it could be.</p>

                Hobbies

                </h1>
                <p>Beyond engineering, I find joy in the little things that fuel my creativity and curiosity. Photography helps me capture moments from unique perspectives, while cooking allows me to experiment and create with my hands. Music is my constant companion, chess sharpens my strategic thinking, and reading books gives me both escape and inspiration. Together, these hobbies keep me grounded, imaginative, and always eager to learn</p>

                </h1>
                <p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Mechatronics Engineering, with a strong interest in aviation and avionics systems. My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in engineering principles, automation, and embedded systems, while I actively explore applications in AI and defense technology.</p>
                <p>Beyond academics, I’ve demonstrated leadership and initiative, such as leading a student protest for better facilities that resulted in long-term reforms. I enjoy tackling complex problem-solving in mathematics and engineering, and I balance my technical interests with curiosity in research and hands-on innovation. Looking ahead, I aim to specialize in defense aircraft design and advanced stealth systems, combining my passion for aviation with my engineering background.</p>
