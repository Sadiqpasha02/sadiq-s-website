                <h2>hi, I am sadiq</h2>
                <p>I’m endlessly curious about how things work — from engines and drones to AI and the mysteries of space.<br>For me, engineering isn’t just about solving problems, it’s about asking better questions and exploring ideas that push me to learn more every day.<br>This space is where I share my experiments, thoughts, and the journey of figuring things out — one challenge at a time.</p>
                <h3>you can find about me from the above grids </h3>
            </div>
            <div class  = "about">
                <h1 id = "about">About me</h1>
                <p>I’m an aspiring engineer with a strong curiosity for how complex systems work — from machines and aircraft to code and the universe itself. My interests span across mechanical engineering, AI, aviation, and even astrophysics, and I enjoy exploring how these fields connect.</p>
                <p>I am a student of engineering with a deep interest in understanding how systems function and how they can be improved. My academic and personal explorations span across several domains — from mechanical design, automobiles, and drones to avionics, artificial intelligence, and astrophysics. What drives me is not only the ability to solve problems, but the curiosity to ask why systems work the way they do, and how they might be reimagined for the future.</p>
                
                <p>At the same time, I believe that technical knowledge must be balanced with perspective and reflection. My passion for philosophy allows me to think critically and approach challenges from multiple viewpoints, while photography and my connection with nature cultivate patience, observation, and creativity. These interests shape the way I learn and work, reminding me that progress is not only about precision and efficiency but also about understanding context and meaning</p>
                <p>What drives me is the urge to learn, question, and experiment. I believe that growth doesn’t come from following a single path, but from combining knowledge across disciplines and applying it creatively.</p>
                <p>For me, every project — whether it’s coding, building, or problem-solving — is an opportunity to understand a little more, and to push myself closer to turning ideas into reality.</p>
                <p>My goal is to grow both as an engineer and as an individual — to combine technical expertise with human values, and to contribute in ways that are purposeful, thoughtful, and innovative.</p>

                </h1>
                <p>Beyond engineering, I find joy in the little things that fuel my creativity and curiosity. Photography helps me capture moments from unique perspectives, while cooking allows me to experiment and create with my hands. Music is my constant companion, chess sharpens my strategic thinking, and reading books gives me both escape and inspiration. Together, these hobbies keep me grounded, imaginative, and always eager to learn</p>
